## 1. Product One-Pager

A one-pager is a concise, executive-level summary designed to secure buy-in and align stakeholders.

### Product One-Pager: Proactive Procurement Copilot

**Problem:**  
Enterprise procurement is a bottleneck. It is a slow, manual, and opaque process bogged down by repetitive research, complex compliance checks, and lengthy negotiations. This leads to extended cycle times, higher operational costs, and increased risk of non-compliance.

**Solution:**  
The Proactive Procurement Copilot is an intelligent, agentic system that transforms procurement from a reactive, manual function into a proactive, automated one. It employs a "crew" of specialized AI agents that collaborate to manage the end-to-end procurement workflow. A user simply delegates a high-level goal (e.g., *"Source a new cloud data warehouse provider"*), and the AI crew autonomously handles the research and initial vetting.

**Target Audience:**  
Procurement officers, legal and compliance teams, and finance departments in mid-to-large enterprises.

**Key Features (Multi-Agent Crew):**
- **Researcher Agent:** Scans internal databases and the public web to identify potential vendors.  
- **Compliance Agent:** Vets vendors against internal policies via AI-driven analysis.  
- **Summarizer Agent:** Generates concise vendor briefs and comparison matrices for human review.  

**Business Impact:**
- **Reduce Cycle Times:** Projecting a 50% reduction in the time from request to contract.  
- **Lower Operational Costs:** Automating up to 70% of manual research and vetting tasks.  
- **Improve Compliance:** Ensuring 100% of vendors are checked against compliance protocols automatically.

## 2. Product Requirements Document (PRD) Snippet

The PRD is the single source of truth that details the product's purpose, features, and functionality for the development team.

### PRD: Proactive Procurement Copilot V1

#### 1. User Personas

- **Patricia, the Procurement Officer**  
  Overwhelmed with manual research tasks. Needs to find and vet vendors quickly to meet business deadlines. Values speed, accuracy, and compliance.  

- **Leo, the Legal Counsel**  
  Responsible for mitigating risk. Needs to ensure all new vendors meet strict compliance standards. Values thoroughness and auditability.  

#### 2. User Stories & Functional Requirements (MVP)

**Epic: Autonomous Vendor Sourcing**

- **PP-01 (Patricia):** As Patricia, I want to submit a natural language request for a new product or service so that I can initiate the sourcing process without filling out complex forms.  
- **PP-02 (System):** As the Researcher Agent, upon receiving a sourcing request, I need to execute searches against our internal vendor database (Google Sheet) and a public web search API to identify potential suppliers.  
- **PP-03 (System):** As the Compliance Agent, given a list of potential suppliers, I need to use an LLM to analyze their descriptions and determine if they meet a specified compliance rule (e.g., *"SOC 2 compliant"*).  
- **PP-04 (System):** As the Summarizer Agent, given the outputs from the previous agents, I need to generate a single-page summary document that lists the vendors, their key offerings, and their compliance status.  
- **PP-05 (Patricia):** As Patricia, I want to receive the summary document in my email within minutes of my initial request, so I can review the AI-generated findings.  

#### 3. Success Metrics

- **Primary:** *Time-to-Source* (Time from request to delivery of summary document). **Target:** < 5 minutes.  
- **Secondary:** *Human Effort Reduction* (Projected percentage of manual research time saved). **Target:** 70%.
