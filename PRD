## 1. Overview & Strategic Fit

This document outlines the product requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the **Proactive Procurement Copilot**.  

The product is an intelligent, multi-agent system designed to automate the initial, most time-consuming stages of the enterprise procurement lifecycle: vendor discovery, research, and initial compliance vetting.  

This initiative directly supports the strategic business goal of leveraging agentic AI to drive significant operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve compliance in core business functions. It serves as a single source of truth for all teams involved in its development.

## 2. Problem Statement

Enterprise procurement is a critical business function that is frequently hampered by **slow, manual, and opaque processes**. Procurement officers spend an estimated **70% of their time on low-value, repetitive tasks** such as manually searching for potential vendors, cross-referencing internal databases, and performing initial compliance checks.  

This manual workflow leads to:

- **Extended Sourcing Cycles**: The time from identifying a need to having a vetted list of vendors can take days or weeks, creating significant bottlenecks for the business.  
- **High Operational Costs**: The manual effort required represents a substantial and unnecessary operational cost.  
- **Increased Risk of Non-Compliance**: Manual vetting is prone to human error, increasing the risk that a non-compliant or high-risk vendor enters the supply chain.  

> Current solutions are often rigid, rules-based systems that are ill-equipped to handle the dynamic and unstructured nature of strategic sourcing.

## 3. User Personas

### Primary Persona: **Patricia, the Procurement Officer**

- **Bio:**  
  A mid-level procurement manager at a large tech company, responsible for sourcing new vendors for various internal departments. She is detail-oriented and constantly under pressure to meet deadlines.  

- **Goals:**  
  - Reduce the time it takes to find and qualify new vendors.  
  - Ensure all vendor recommendations are compliant with company policy from the outset.  
  - Focus more of her time on strategic activities like negotiation and relationship management.  

- **Pain Points:**  
  - "I'm overwhelmed by the amount of manual web searching and data entry required for every new sourcing request."  
  - "The back-and-forth with the legal team to get initial compliance checks done is a major bottleneck."  
  - "I worry about missing a critical detail in a vendor's security policy, which could have serious consequences."  

---

### Secondary Persona: **Leo, the Legal Counsel**

- **Bio:**  
  In-house counsel specializing in vendor contracts and compliance. He is risk-averse and values thoroughness and auditability above all else.  

- **Goals:**  
  - Mitigate risk for the company by ensuring every new vendor meets strict security and compliance standards (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001).  
  - Standardize the initial vetting process to ensure consistency.  

- **Pain Points:**  
  - "I often receive incomplete or inaccurate information from the procurement team, which forces me to redo their work."  
  - "I spend too much time on repetitive, low-risk compliance reviews instead of focusing on complex contract negotiations."
